I have 15 A4 papers in which there are picture of varying size.
Each A4 paper contain a single picture which not exactly placed at an angle of 90 degree.(for e.g a picture is placed at an 30 degree in the A4 sheet)

The goal is to calculate the angle at which this picture would turn into 90 degree.
Using your own figures, crop and resize the picture and rotate picture to make it as it should be feasible.

(hint first rotate,then crop and resize )
